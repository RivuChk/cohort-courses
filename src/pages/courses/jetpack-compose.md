title: Master Jetpack Compose | Beginner to Advanced
description: This course is for Android Developers, with a fair understanding of Android basics,  Architecture patterns, etc. We’ll start with an introduction to Jetpack Compose, and how to use it, and slowly we’ll move on to the advanced stuff, and learn the internal workings of Jetpack Compose, and performance optimizations. We’ll do theoretical as well as hands-on.
