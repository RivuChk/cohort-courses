title: Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) | Beginner to Advanced
description: For any developers willing to learn Kotlin Multiplatform, to be able to share code between all platforms.
  Developers would be required to be proficient with Kotlin. They’d be given a Kotlin quiz at the time of joining the course, failing which they’d be required to take the Kotlin Language course before starting this course. 
  If you're new to Kotlin, I'd recommend buying this course along with the Kotlin Language one.
